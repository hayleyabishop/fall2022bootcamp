i. "clear"
ii. Trick question; you can't open tabs on a windows terminal / WLP terminal. Shift-click the taskbar icon to open a new window. On Linux, you could press shift-ctrl-t to open a new tab, or shift-alt-t to open a new window.
iii. I'd use the up arrow. 
iv. mv 1.txt folder/1.txt && mv 2.txt folder/2.txt && mv 3.txt folder/3.txt
v. comm myfile1.txt myfile2.txt
vi. rm -r ./
vii. ls -a *.css
viii. find directory -name "filename" 
ix.a. grep -l -R "search term" ./* 
ix.b. cd / && grep -l -R "search term" 
x. touch YourName.txt && ls -l YourName.txt
x.a. (after first adding metadata access to wsl.pref) sudo chmod 777 YourName.txt
x.b. sudo chmod 600 YourName.txt
