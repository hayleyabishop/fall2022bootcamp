Many people would try to be similar to Steve Jobs in belief and habit, thinking that they, too, could become as successful as Jobs. However, success on such a scale is near impossible for anyone, and depends on external chance. 

Does acting like an ultra-wealthy person increase wealth? Does it make us feel closer to and more respected by those individuals if we take on their habits?

    <!-- About the Author
    The author was 6 years old when the first iPod was released. ... The author has known many close friends who have been sucked in by the 'millionaire grindset' and a blind worship of the wealthy, and the author has watched many facets of society continue to bend to the will of the wealthy (ex. Kardashians, Musk)
    The author has seen firsthand how the concept of 'fake it 'til you make it' and 'if you can dream it, you can do it' have driven folks to believe that if they don't 'make it', they just haven't been working hard enough. The 'entrepreneur' mindset can be toxic when overly self-confident, and mixed with a despairing narcissism/lack of self-esteem.
